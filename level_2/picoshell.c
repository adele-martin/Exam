The picoshell function is executed by the original (parent) process. It sets up the pipes,
forks off the child processes to execute the commands, manages the file descriptors,
and then waits for the children to finish. The parent itself doesnâ€™t run the commands
directly; it orchestrates their execution by creating child processes.*/

/*
Main process executes
-first command
-second command
-fork a pipe

We need to take the stdout of the first command as stdin to pipe.
We are simulating the shell's file descriptors stdin and stdout.

Since the first command is happening in the main process
we ought to tweak it to it doesnt output in the stdout.
So we have to dup2()!
